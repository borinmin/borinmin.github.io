### Why am I here?
```commandline

It has several huge purposes to be here.

1. Share about myself and sharing of what I've been having.

2. Technology is defined as changing.
So, if you would like to be able to kick technology's ass , you have to stay up late night and hate bed.
3. Writing here about programming technique, assistant tools, It maybe my pleasure.
